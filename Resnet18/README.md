### Method
Resnet18 is trained with curriculum learning. <br>
Other models apart from Resnet18 can also be used, by just importing different model. <br>
We can also fine tune the model by first running Pytorch-SimSiam code and then running classifier_curriculum_learning.py with fine_tune set to True

### Datset
